Yes, it is my great pleasure to be here to present our latest access protocol, Web3 URL, which is designed for Ethereum virtual machine to be able to access the future of the data and enable a lot of new applications that we believe that future Ethereum can enable. So first of all, what is Web3 access protocol? It's defined in ERC 4804, Web3 URL standard, which was finalized the day before yesterday, which we have a very good timing, and it is an IANA register scheme. It actually is an HTTP-like URL, but instead of locating decentralized resources hosted on a server, it's designed to locate a decentralized resource hosted by a smart contract or mapped by ENS. It has a very similar semantics with HTTP, and with corresponding, for example, path, and also for some query, and you can find more details of EIP 4804, the final specification in the EIP repo, and there is also Web3 URL, you can find a lot of examples that are live and using Web3 URL. We also offer a bounty for the developers who are now able to use Web3 URL to develop awesome applications. So why we need kind of like a Web3 URL, and what is the motivation? The original motivation we are developing this access protocol is that we found a lot of more and more MFTs that are moving fully on chain. For example, to name a few, there are cyber-blockers, NUMS, and there are more and more coming. Why? Because they would like to have a fully decentralized MFT, not only the token contract, but also the corresponding data, for example, images, and it can be also music, or maybe videos that are fully on chain. When a user buys a token, it's not only just by a token URL with a token ID on a smart contract but also owns the actual images that will never disappear on chain. However, when I actually bought a few, and also started all this project, I was quite surprised. All these images, they are now actually using third-party to render those images. For example, they are using HTTP for the distant moon birds and also IPFS. And even if they have all the data on chain, that is quite counterintuitive because now we have Ethereum and we have all data, why not just use Ethereum to render all these resources directly? And that is the original motivation we developed the web3 access protocol which allows the user to browse all these images or any web contents directly on the Ethereum smart contracts. So for example, here are a couple of examples that now we are able to use in web3 URL to browse all these images, and all these URLs are actually ineffective. So if you type this URL in Firefox with our extension, then you are able to directly browse all these images on Ethereum. And this is something we believe we should be actually widely adopted in all the projects that have all this web content that is available on Ethereum. And how to use web3 URL? So basically, it inherits most features of HTTP which is already widely adopted for the whole internet. It has a decentralized authority which is a contract or a name for a name service, where right now we have fully integrated with ENS. And there's also defined a way to call a smart contract that is core data. And lastly, there's a format of how the data will be presented in the browser. It can be a JSON file or it can be natively web objects, pictures, webs, JavaScripts, anything can be displayed using web3 URL. And there's a lot of examples of how to use web3 URL, so we can check the web3 URL website. The website itself, so the link here is still HTTP, but itself is already hosted using web3 URL and running on top of Ethereum. So another question is how I can access EVM using web3 URL? So there are a couple of ways, but at the beginning, since we start, since this standard just has three days, just born after three days since its finalisation, so we have launched the gateway to support the web3 URL at the beginning. And so web3 ether.io is the current gateway for the Ethereum. So for example, if you type web3 URL with web3 URL.is, that's our home page to introduce web3 URL, then you can just place web3 URL as a subdomain of the gateway, and now you're able to browse the content that is hosted on the Ethereum. We also have a Firefox extension that is able to translate a web3 URL to the HTTP gateway link, and, as a road map, we are also doing native integration with modern browsers such as Brave, Carbon, Firefox itself, and Chrome. And we also support multiple blockchains. The web3 URL is designed to support multiple blockchains, for example, we have already supported this is just a few blockchains we are currently supporting in Ethereum test nets, and also, for example, our other network like BNB chain, or Avalanche, and we are also going to extend the standard to support heterogeneous blockchains like Bitcoin. So what are the new applications that can enable by the web3 URL? We believe there are tons of applications. One natural application is the images. So for example, CyberBlock, they upload all the metadata, SVG layers, on chain, and compose them using smart contracts. And using web3 URL, we deploy a contract that combines these layers together and returns a string to the contract. And now, using this web3 URL, we can directly call this contract with a method that we can render any token URI, any token. And another interesting experiment we are doing is Vitalik's blog. So we upload the whole Vitalik's blog which contains 40 megabytes of data on the contract to Arbitrary Nova which is the main net of layer 2 on Ethereum. And this only costs 0.13 Ether, roughly $300, but now, even the Vitalik's personal website is down, but we have something, some main net that is able to host Vitalik's website forever on his Ethereum network. And it will receive a wide reception from the community. There are tons of discussions on how we do this, and how the web3 URL works, and feel free to leave your comments in the Reddit. And still, to support a personal website, we also propose ERC5018. It is a kind of file system-like interface so that we are able to mimic a file system using a smart contract, and using a tool we call ETHFS uploader to synchronise local folders and files with the blockchain. And that's how we are able to just use a single command and synchronise all Vitalik's blog to the blockchain on Arbitrary Nova. And so, for our bounty, welcome to use our tools and to deploy all kinds of interesting applications that you can imagine, crazy ideas. So imagine there are more and more applications that we are able to enable besides these two examples. For example, one big application we are imagining is dynamic websites with multi-user interactions. Decentralised email, Git, or anything we can imagine on the web2 world, now it is possible on web3. For example, we have a Git3 version, right now, we are giving a demo, and we are able to use all the Git with a translate to web3 URL. Now we are able to develop Ethereum on top of Ethereum. That is something unimaginable before. So you can check out all these applications, a lot of them are live or running on testnet, and feel free to come up with your crazy ideas. And so one problem is, oh, that's amazing. And is everything that we can do anything on the web2? Wait a minute. We still have a lot of problems to solve on the infrastructure layer. So the critical issue here is that the storage costs on Ethereum will be super, super expensive on mainnet. For example, one gigabyte of data, on-chain data, will cost roughly ten million US dollars. That is unacceptable for a lot of web2 applications, even for a lot of MFTs, they have very few metadata, they're very expensive, but still super expensive. One solution that we can find a route for to alleviate this problem is to use Aperture Nova with DAC, which we already experimented with Vitalik's blog on top of that. But at the same time, we believe we need even better solutions to address this storage issue so that we are able to combine the power of storage and also Ethereum, both in terms of scalability. And so that's why we propose storage that is a storage layer, native storage layer for Ethereum, designed for Ethereum. It aims to scale the Ethereum storage to petabytes with 1 to the 1,000 cost reduction. And thanks to the Ethereum Foundation, we also received a grant support for the storage project itself, which was just announced last month with the layer 2 community grant. So with all these possibilities that we enable on top of Ethereum infrastructure, we believe that we are able to achieve much, much better web3 that build on top of Ethereum, so we are able to scale dramatically so that we can serve anybody, anywhere in the world with billions of users. And we can be much, much more fully decentralised versus we still have to rely on HTTP, DNS, all kinds of centralised components. We have native web3 access protocol so that we are able to perform from an EVM, elastic storage, the whole stack now can be fully decentralised on top of Ethereum. And we do not need to another third-party trust in the whole layers. And so thank you very much for attending my presentations. I was really happy to answer your questions, and after the stage, we also have a booth near the Polygon. So welcome to come. And I'm happy to look forward to see you there. So thank you very much.
